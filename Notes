Context Switch
Switching of the CPU from one process or thread to another. In Linux threads share an address space and other resources with their parent processes. A context is the contents of a CPUâ€™s registers and program counter at any point in time. A program counter is a specialized register that indicates the position of the CPU in its instruction sequence and which holds either the address of the instruction being executed or the address of the next instruction executed. 
When a programmer programs an OS he/she decides whether to code the scheduler with a round-robin scheduling system, a first-come first-serve system, or some other type of algorithm to decide what the order of the programs are executed in. The context occurs only in kernel mode which is a privileged mode of the CPU. When kernel mode is running it provides access to all memory locations and all other system resources. Other applications operate in user mode, but they can run portions of the kernel code via system calls. A system-call is a request in a UNIX-like operating system by an active process for a service performed by the kernel.
